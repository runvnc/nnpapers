I'm trying to learn some basics about neural networks.

I have found many tutorials online.

However, I discovered that as far as understanding the most basic aspects of these things from
the perspective of a programmer trying to code them, the original papers seem to explain them more clearly.  Going back to like 1986 or 1999 for example.

## Backpropagation

## Convolution
